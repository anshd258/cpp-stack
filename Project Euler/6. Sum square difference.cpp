/// Sum square difference

//The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

//The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,
// (1 + 2 + 3 ... 10) = 55 =3025
//Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers and the square of the sum is .
//3025 - 385 =2640
//Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.
